This post is not about a program that got out of hand; I sort of expect things to get complicated when I'm coding. No, this is about doing the video for my first portfolio project, because wow, did that become A Process. 

Last year, in late summer or thereabouts, I participated in Flatiron School's beta cohort program. It's probably a good thing that I did. The cohort I was part of got me through the first portfolio project, and I was able to do my project review as part of the program before finishing the blog post and video requirements. Thus, I've been able to progress in the curriculum without stumbling over the video for *months* before doing the review. It's taken me a long time to do the video partly out of time management issues (i.e. procrastination) and partly out of unforseen technical problems. 

I had naively thought that making a video about my project would be a simple matter of recording my screen while I talked out loud about my project, showing the code and running the program in the terminal. 

Nooooope! 

See, I'm using a 17-inch MacBook Pro from 2011. It's still running pretty well, after I've replaced the logic board (on Apple's dime) several times. However, it still has a tendency to run hot when doing graphics-intensive things. Like doing a screenshare or recording a video. So when I do these things, the fans kick on to full intensity. When I made my first attempt at recording the project walkthrough video - by recording my screen along with audio - the result was an inaudible mess. Obviously I had to take a different approach. 

To get around the problem of my fans making a lot of noise right next to my built-in microphone, and the lack of money to by another microphone, I recorded the audio and video separately. This required writing a script and dividing it into sections based on what was going to be onscreen for each section (the website I used for the project, the code files displayed in the text editor, the code in action in the terminal). I put timing tags in my script so that I could try to syncronize what I was saying with what was onscreen, and make sure the clips were the same length to make editing easier. 

So once I had my script, I recorded the audio for each section and then listened to the clips to note times in the script. I had to edit and re-record one section, because between my initial writing and and voiceover-recording day, there was a subtle change to the website I used for the project and showed in the video - the map of parks on the City of Albuquerque website now has outlines on the map showing the locations of the parks instead of pins. 

I hit a couple of other snags, like forgetting that the command to type in to run the program is ```ruby bin/burque_trails``` and leaving off the "ruby" part, resulting in a permissions error I fixed instead of just typing the correct command. And then I did the screen recording for the section demonstrating the program three times because the first two clips were shorter than the audio clip to go with it. 

After all this, I've learned a lot about editing videos with Quicktime (which is very basic editing), about breaking bigger projects into smaller bits, and about learning from failures. The first failed attempt at making the video gave me some useful information about what didn't work, and a problem to solve in order to be more successful. 

The finished result is [here](https://youtu.be/gVAorKy4idM). It's not perfect, but it's done.
