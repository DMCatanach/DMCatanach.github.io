Doing the Flatiron School online web developer program in a mid-sized city with no WeWork location can be a bit isolated. The local tech scene isn’t exactly huge either, but there are a few Meetup groups that generally meet once a month. I haven’t attended all of them, but I’ve made a point of going to the Rubyists group as often as is possible. 

Last week was the most recent opportunity, and I’d had plans to write up some notes about specific things I learned at it. But, I hadn’t actually written anything down, because I figured I’d remember it long enough to get home and do that. However, I didn’t, so instead I’ll write about the experience a little more generally. 

The Rubyists group sometimes meets with a specific topic, and sometimes not. When there isn’t a presentation already lined up, it’s a pretty open forum. There’s a projector set up for anyone to plug in their laptop and talk about a project they’re working on, or a problem they’ve been wrestling with. At last week’s meeting, a couple of people talked about their current projects, and I learned a bit about the #send method. Now I have a slightly clearer idea of what it is and how it works. (I mean, it’s still a pretty blurry conception in my mind, but not a complete mess.) Last month, we did a code along playing with Docker and Convox. I haven’t yet presented anything myself, but I enjoy the conversation over pizza and beer, and usually pick up a bit of knowledge along the way.
