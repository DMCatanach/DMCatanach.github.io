This post is just a test to see if I can actually add anything to this blog page. I don't have access to the Flatiron School's blogging tool, since I'm no longer in the program, and haven't been for a while. Now I'm finally getting around to poking around and figuring out how to work with the page on my own. Not that I'm going to keep it like this, because my real project is to figure out how to change the page entirely so that I can put my portfolio up on my Github.io page instead. To do that, though, I'm first testing this out to make sure I've cloned things correctly and can make changes to the repo.
