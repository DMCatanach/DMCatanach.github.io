This post is just a test to see if I can actually add anything to this blog page. I don't have access to the Flatiron School's blogging tool, since I'm no longer in the program, and haven't been for a while. Now I'm finally getting around to poking around and figuring out how to work with the page on my own. Not that I'm going to keep it like this, because my real project is to figure out how to change the page entirely so that I can put my portfolio up on my Github.io page instead. To do that, though, I'm first testing this out to make sure I've cloned things correctly and can make changes to the repo. 

And the test is a success! I've done it the hard way, but I've published a new post to this page. I say the hard way, because I have no idea how Jekyll and Grunt work here. So I'm doing this all by hand. I cloned the repo to my computer and then gone in via the terminal and created the new file and practiced my mad Git skills to commit the changes and push them up to the GitHub repo. And now it shows up on the page! I'm quite glad to know that it worked. Now I can make all the changes I want. 

And there are going to be some pretty big changes. This blog is going to go away entirely, so that I can instead put up the beginnings of my web development portfolio. Even though I'm not in the Flatiron School program, I'm still continuing my studies by other means. And now it is time to show off the things I've made.
